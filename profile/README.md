## 🚀 Welcome to **DIGIT-X**

We're a new lab based in the Department of Radiology at LMU Klinikum, Munich. We're quietly but intentionally rethinking how medical data is structured, connected, and turned into knowledge that actually helps in clinical care.

We care about infrastructure — how imaging connects with clinical silos, how systems talk to each other, and how AI can act as a transparent, explainable catalyst for clinical decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Working at the intersection of healthcare data, AI, and informatics
- Rethinking structure — technically, semantically, and systemically
- Building tools that are useful, reproducible, and explainable
- Staying grounded in clinical reality, even when the tech gets abstract
