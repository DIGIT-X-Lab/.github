# 🧠 DIGIT-X Lab

Welcome to **DIGIT-X** — a new lab based in the Department of Radiology at LMU Klinikum, Munich.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

We're quietly but intentionally rethinking how medical data is structured, connected, and turned into knowledge that actually helps in clinical care.

We care about infrastructure — how imaging connects with clinical silos, how systems talk to each other, and how AI can act as a transparent, explainable catalyst for clinical decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Focus Areas

- Working at the intersection of healthcare data, AI, and informatics
- Rethinking structure — technically, semantically, and systemically
- Building tools that are useful, reproducible, and explainable
- Staying grounded in clinical reality, even when the tech gets abstract
